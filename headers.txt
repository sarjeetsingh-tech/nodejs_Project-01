HTTP Headers are an important part of the API request and response as they represent the
 meta-data associated with the API request and response. Headers carry information for:

Request and Response Body
Request Authorization
Response Caching 
Response Cookies

Other than the above categories HTTP headers also carry a lot of other information around 
HTTP connection types, proxies etc. Most of these headers are for management of connections 
between client, server and proxies and do not require explicit validation through testing

Headers are mostly classified as request headers and response headers, know the major request
 and response headers.
